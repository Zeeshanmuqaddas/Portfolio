**Portfolio**  

Welcome to my portfolio! I am Zeeshan Ansari, a passionate web developer with 2 to 3 years of experience in creating modern and user-friendly websites. I specialize in front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, with a focus on frameworks like Next.js. I have a background in marketing and currently serve as a Marketing Manager at a garment company, where I blend technology and strategy to drive business growth.  

In addition to my professional work, I am actively expanding my skill set by pursuing courses in Web 3, Artificial Intelligence, and Metaverse through the Governor Sindh IT Initiative. I also teach aspiring developers, sharing my knowledge to contribute to the tech community.  

I invite you to explore my projects and get in touch if you are interested in collaborating or learning more about my work.
