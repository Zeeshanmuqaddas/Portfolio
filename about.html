             **Our Story – Zeeshan Ansari**  

My name is Zeeshan Ansari, and this is the story of my journey. I started my educational path by completing matriculation from Primary School in 2005, followed by intermediate studies at Government College Boys North Nazimabad. With a strong determination to excel, I continued my academic pursuit and graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree from Elma University.  

Education played a significant role in shaping my future, but my journey didn’t stop there. I entered the professional world with a keen interest in marketing and a vision to contribute to the garment industry. Today, I am proud to be a part of **Zako Tex Garments**, where I work as a Marketing Specialist. My role involves developing marketing strategies, building strong relationships with clients, and ensuring that our brand stands out in a competitive market.  

Working with Zako Tex Garments has been a rewarding experience. It has allowed me to combine my academic knowledge with real-world challenges, contributing to the growth and success of the company. As I move forward, I am driven by the passion to keep learning, growing, and making a meaningful impact in the industry.  

This is my story—a journey of perseverance, learning, and dedication. And it’s just the beginning.
