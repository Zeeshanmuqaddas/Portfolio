            <h2>Welcome to My journey</h2>
            <p>  I am a skilled and passionate web developer with 2 to 3 years of hands-on experience in designing and building responsive, interactive, and visually appealing websites and applications. My journey in web development began with mastering fundamental technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and over time, I have expanded my expertise to include advanced frameworks such as Next.js and TypeScript. My educational background, including a Bachelor of Science degree from Elma University (2019-2023), has provided me with a strong understanding of programming principles, problem-solving techniques, and modern development practices.

                Currently, I am focused on delivering innovative solutions that not only meet but exceed client expectations. My approach involves writing clean and maintainable code, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless user experiences across all devices. I have a keen eye for detail, which helps me design websites that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I also prioritize staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies to ensure my work remains relevant and cutting-edge.
                
                As a web developer, I take pride in my ability to collaborate effectively with teams and communicate technical concepts clearly to clients and stakeholders. I aim to continuously grow in my field by tackling challenging projects that push my boundaries, improve my skills, and contribute to the digital transformation of businesses.</p>
